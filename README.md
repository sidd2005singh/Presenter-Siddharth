## 🧱 Project overview

This is a **frontend‑only web app** built with:

- **HTML** – structure of the page.  
- **CSS** – styling of the T‑shirt and UI.  
- **JavaScript** – interactivity (color change, text update, logo upload).

No backend server or database is required; everything runs in the browser.

### Features

- Choose a T‑shirt color using a color picker.  
- Add custom text that appears on the T‑shirt.  
- Upload a logo or image and see it overlaid on the T‑shirt.  
- Live preview of the branded T‑shirt in the browser.  
- Ready to publish and share via Replit’s hosting.

## 🚀 How to use this repo

Open index.html in your browser, or serve it with a simple server:

bash
npx serve
Option 2: Use it on Replit (recommended)
Go to replit.com and log in.

Create a new “HTML, CSS, JS” Repl.

Copy the contents of:

index.html

style.css

script.js
into the corresponding files in your Replit project.

Click “Run” to see the app in the live preview.

Make changes and see them reflected instantly.

🖼️ How the app works (high‑level)
index.html

Defines the page structure: title, color picker, text input, file upload, and T‑shirt preview area.

style.css

Styles the T‑shirt box, centers text and logo, and makes the UI clean and mobile‑friendly.

script.js

Listens to:

Color picker → changes the T‑shirt background color.

Text input → updates the text on the T‑shirt.

File upload → displays the uploaded logo on the T‑shirt.

No external libraries are required; everything uses native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🛠️ How to extend this project
You can use this as a base and add more features, such as:

Download the branded T‑shirt image (using html2canvas or similar).

Save/share designs (localStorage or a simple backend).

Add more customization options (font, size, position of text/logo).

Integrate AI (e.g., generate slogans or logos using an LLM API).

🌐 How to publish on Replit
Make sure your app runs correctly in the Web Preview.

Click the “Publish” button in the top‑right corner of Replit.

Choose “Autoscale deployment” (recommended).

Click “Deploy”.

Replit will give you a public URL like:

tshirt-branding-app.siddharth.repl.co (or your username).

Share this URL with anyone – your T‑Shirt Branding Web App is now live on the internet.

You can:

- Replace `HENU-OS` / `tshirt-branding-webapp` with your actual org and repo name.  
- Add a **screenshot** in the repo and link it in the README (e.g., `![T‑Shirt Branding App](screenshots/app.png)`).  

If you want, I can also generate a **shorter “cheat‑sheet” README** (1 page) specifically for hackers to quickly run and play with the app.
